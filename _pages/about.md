I am a Computer Science Master's student at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (ENS Paris-Saclay). My main research interests are quantum computing, cryptography and complexity theory. 

Starting from march I will be working with [Alex Bredariol Grilo](https://abgrilo.github.io/) on a quantum complexity analysis of the Uhlmann tranformation problem and its link to zero-knowledge proofs. 

Last semester I worked at the IQC at University of Waterloo Canada, under the supervision of [Samuel Jaques](https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/) on the addressability problem on CSS quantum error correcting codes.

Before this, I did an internship at IRISA Rennes with [Pierre-Alain Fouque](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/), where I was studying a [paper](https://jerome-guyot.github.io/files/ducas_paper.pdf) by [Léo Ducas](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~ducas/) and trying to find a better algorithm for solving ZLIP the isomorphism problem over orthonormal lattices.

I am also a tennis player, and I play the drums. 

Feel free to message me if you want to get in touch!
