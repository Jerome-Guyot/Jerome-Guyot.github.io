I am a Computer Science Master's student at [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) (ENS Paris-Saclay). My main research interests are quantum computing, cryptography and complexity theory. 

Starting from October and until August 2026, I will be working with [Tom Gur](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/tg508) at Cambridge University on Probabistically Checkable Proofs (PCP). 

From March to September 2025 I worked at Sorbonne Université (Paris, France) with [Alex Bredariol Grilo](https://abgrilo.github.io/) on no-signaling secure bit commitments.

During winter and spring 2024, I worked at the IQC at University of Waterloo Canada, under the supervision of [Samuel Jaques](https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/) on the addressability problem on CSS quantum error correcting codes.

Before this, I did an internship at IRISA Rennes with [Pierre-Alain Fouque](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/), where I was studying a [paper](https://jerome-guyot.github.io/files/ducas_paper.pdf) by [Léo Ducas](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~ducas/) and trying to find a better algorithm for solving ZLIP the isomorphism problem over orthonormal lattices.

I am also a tennis player, and I play the drums. 

Feel free to message me if you want to get in touch !
