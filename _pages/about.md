I am a Computer Science Master student at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay (part of Université Paris-Saclay). My main research interests are cryptography, quantum computing and complexity theory. I am currently doing a research internship at the IQC University of Waterloo, Canada under the supervision of Samuel Jaques. My current internship is about addressable gates on CSS quantum error correcting codes.

Before this, I did an internship at IRISA Rennes with Pierre-Alain Fouque, where I was studying a paper by Léo Ducas and trying to find a better algorithms for solving ZLIP the isomorphism problem over orthonormal lattices.

I am also a tennis player, and I play the drums. 

Feel free to message me if you want to get in touch!
