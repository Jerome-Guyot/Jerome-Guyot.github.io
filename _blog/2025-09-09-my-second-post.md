Welcome to my blog!

This is the first post on my website. I plan to write about my research, interesting papers I've read, and maybe some coding tutorials.

## Markdown is Supported

You can write in Markdown, which makes formatting easy.

* Lists are easy
* So are **bold** and *italic* text

You can also include images:

Hereâ€™s a code block:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
