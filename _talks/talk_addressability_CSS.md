Abstract.
Quantum computers are highly susceptible to noise, necessitating error-correcting codes for reliable computation. Among these, Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes provide a robust framework. However, the addressability problem—the ability to apply fault-tolerant operations to specific logical qubits—remains a critical challenge, especially in high-rate codes. This paper explores impossibility results for addressable gates in CSS codes and discusses potential paths forward, offering insights into the trade-offs between code performance and computational efficiency.
