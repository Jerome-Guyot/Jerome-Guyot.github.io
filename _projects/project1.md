Abstract. This paper investigates the state complexities of subword-closed and
superword-closed languages, comparing them to regular languages. We focus on
the square root operator and the substitution operator. We establish an exponential
lower bound for superword-closed languages for the í‘›-th root. For subword-closed
languages we analyze in detail a specific instance of the square root problem for
which a quadratic complexity is proven. For the substitution operator, we show
an exponential lower bound for the general substitution. We then find some conditions for which we prove a quadratic upper bound.
